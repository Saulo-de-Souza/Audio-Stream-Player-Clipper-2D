description="Maximize your control over audio in your Godot projects with AudioStreamPlayerClipper2D, a solution for audio clipping that goes beyond the engine's native capabilities. 
Precisely set the start and end points of your audio clips quickly and intuitively through the editor. Full support for all platforms, including web (the audio loop with offset in Godot currently does not work for web). AudioStreamPlayerClipper2D ensures that your audio cuts and adjustments are maintained accurately across all platforms. Additionally, streamline your workflow with the ability to test audio directly in the editor inspector, without needing to run the game. Simplify the process of fine-tuning and refining your sounds quickly and efficiently.
